# SnowballR CI

This is the CI repository for the SnowballR project where we maintain commonly used GitHub Actions workflows.
To learn more about the overall system, including its architecture, components, and how it facilitates systematic
literature reviews (SLRs) using snowballing, visit the [SnowballR repo](https://github.com/SE-UUlm/snowballr) and
its [wiki](https://github.com/SE-UUlm/snowballr/wiki).
